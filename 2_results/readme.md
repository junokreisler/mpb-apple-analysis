Plots from the second part of the analysis, including two-way ANOVA results for height-width ratios of each cultivar per year and locaiton. 

Heights, widths (in cm) and height-width ratios are used further in the third part as their own traits.
* The reason for this is that most cultivars do not show a consistent shape class per cultivar, and shape class variance can be approximated with the height-width ratio (more or less flat/bell/etc shaped apples).

For convenience, plots that are done for a subset of cultivars (which led to very many comparison plots) are stored in .zip files.
